<h3>Final Project: Escaping the Maze<h3>
<hr>
  <h5>The main goal of this day was to understand:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Defining and Calling Python Functions</li>
  <li>Indentation in Python</li>
  <li>While Loops</li>
</ul>
  
It was done by resolving simple problems that are offered by https://reeborg.ca/
<br>
 <p>Look below to one of the levels â€“ Escape the Maze.
The robot was spawned at a random place with a random position. You have to build the algorithm to achieve the goal every time.</p>
